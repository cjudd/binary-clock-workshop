# Build a Binary Clock with a Raspberry Pi Zero Workshop

![Binary Clock](images/binaryclock.jpg "Binary Clock")


Have you ever wanted to be the geekiest kid around? This session will earn you the crown. In this session, you build a clock that likely only you can read because it will display the time in binary (1s and 0s or on and off). You will learn how to control LEDs using a Raspberry Pi (Zero). Along the way you will learn a little programming with Python to determine the time and control the LEDs. But of course, you will also have to learn to read binary.

Ages - 12+
Approx. Cost - $22-25
